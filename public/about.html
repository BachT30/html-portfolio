<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello, I'm Bacho Ramishvili, a front-end web developer based in Tbilisi.
  My experience comes from years of working in other fields, but finally, I'm doing the job I enjoy the most.
  Of course, it would have been great to start a career in web development from the beggining, but I don't regret a second of it.
  Previous jobs made me the person I am today. I got to meet great people. I worked all kinds of jobs, like football (soccer) steward,
  customer support operator in an online casino, specialist in a telecommunication company and even director of a land surveyor firm, 
  where i got to make projects for road rehabilitation in my city. So, it's been quite a journey.</p>

<p>Meeting and communicating with all kinds of people, getting to know their personalities and views was quite the experience. Now I'm ready
  for new challenges and looking forward to many opportunities that are on their way.
</p>

<p>I love video games and movies and had the opportunity to open a 'game lounge' near my street, where kids would come to play and enjoy video
   games as I did when I was little. It was great to hang out with them and my friends too, for movie nights, to watch important football games, etc.
